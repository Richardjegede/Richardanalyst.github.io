								<p>Power BI projects focus on using Microsoft’s robust data visualization and business intelligence platform to transform raw data into meaningful, interactive reports and dashboards. These projects typically involve collecting and cleaning data from multiple sources, building efficient data models, and leveraging Power BI’s intuitive tools to create visuals that communicate insights effectively. From tracking business performance and analyzing customer behavior to monitoring key operational metrics, the Power BI projects I have worked on span a wide range of industries and use cases, helping organizations make data-driven decisions with greater clarity and impact. Below are some of the projects.</p>
